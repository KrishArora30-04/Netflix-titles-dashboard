# 📊 Netflix Titles Dashboard

### Tableau Dashboard Based on SQL Analysis

![Netflix Logo](Netflix%20logo.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains an interactive **Tableau Dashboard** created using the *Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset*. The insights presented in this dashboard are derived from extensive **SQL analysis** that I performed in my previous project.

The dashboard visualizes key patterns in Netflix content, including:

* Distribution of Movies vs TV Shows
* Genre trends and category frequency
* Country-wise content availability
* Ratings breakdown
* Release year insights
* Duration analysis for movies and TV shows
* Director- and actor-specific deep dives
* Keyword-based content categorization (e.g., "violence", "kill")

These SQL queries and business problem solutions were originally created in my earlier repository.
